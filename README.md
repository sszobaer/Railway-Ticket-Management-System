- **JDK development Kit:** Available on Oracle [Oracle's official site](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- **Eclips:** You can also use the Eclips instead of Notepad++ [Download the latest version](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

## Get Started

### Clone the Repository

Obtain your own copy of the project with:
    
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sszobaer/Railway-Ticket-Management-System.git
cd Railway-Ticket-Management-System
```

### Environment Setup
To set up your Java environment:

1. **Download and Install JDK**: Ensure that the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your system. [Download the latest JDK version](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) if you havenâ€™t already.

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Add the JDK `bin` directory to your system's PATH variable:
     - **Windows**: 
       1. Open **System Properties** > **Environment Variables**.
       2. Under **System Variables**, find and edit the `Path` variable to include the path to the JDK `bin` folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-x.x.x\bin`).
     - **macOS/Linux**: Open your terminal and edit the `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, or `.zshrc` file, adding `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/jdk/bin`.

3. **Verify the Installation**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the command: `java -version`. If Java is properly installed, it will display the installed Java version.

4. **Install an IDE (Optional)**: 
   - You can use any IDE, but **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse** are recommended for Java development.
